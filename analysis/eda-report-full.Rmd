Following standard research methodology approach, prior to the core phases of data analysis (CFA and SEM, for this study), an exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed. Please note, that exploratory factor analysis (EFA), while also exploratory in nature, corresponds to further phase of this study and, thus, the corresponding section is located outside of the current one. Since both pilot and main data sets are identical parts of the same randomly selected data set and all further statistical analysis had to be performed, using either of the two, the EDA was performed, using only the pilot data set.

This EDA consists of performing both descriptive and visual exploratory analysis for single variables (univariate), as well as for relationships between variables (multivariate).

### Data Screening

Descriptive statistics. The SourceForge pilot data set consists of `r length(dir(file.path(TRANSFORMED_DIR, "SourceForge")))` indicators. The descriptive statistics of the pilot data set, including measures of central tendency (_mean, median_), position (_minimum, maximum, quantiles_), dispersion (_variance, standard deviation, range and interquartile range_) and shape (_modality, skewness and kurtosis_), is summarized in Table \ref{tab:edaDescStats} below.

```{r edaReportSummary, include=FALSE, fig.cap='EDA Report'}
print(describe_flossData)
```

```{r edaReportSummary2, include=TRUE, results='asis', fig.cap='EDA Report'}
print(genEDAdescStatsTable(flossData, label = "edaDescStats"))
```

```{r getRefInfo}
bcRefInfo <- genObjRefs("fig", "barchart_")
histRefInfo <- genObjRefs("fig", "histogram_")
mixpRefInfo <- genObjRefs("fig", "mixplot_")
pmatRefInfo <- genObjRefs("fig", "plotmatrix_")
```

In order to gain some understanding about _data patterns_, the data setâ€™s discrete measures were summarized via _frequency tables_ (containing frequency scores across categorical variables), which can be found in Appendix TODO, as well as visually, using bar charts, as shown in `r bcRefInfo$str` below.

```{r barchartsDynamicChunk, message=TRUE}
barchartChunks <- genDynChunks(bcRefInfo)
```
`r knit(text = barchartChunks)`

Visual overview for continuous (binned) data is presented by histograms in the following `r histRefInfo$str`.

```{r historgramsDynamicChunk, message=TRUE}
histChunks <- genDynChunks(histRefInfo)
```
`r knit(text = histChunks)`

Results of mixture analysis of the pilot data set are presented by histograms with overlay fitted curves in the following `r mixpRefInfo$str`.

```{r mixPlotDynamicChunk, message=TRUE}
mixpChunks <- genDynChunks(mixpRefInfo)
```
`r knit(text = mixpChunks)`

General overview of the pilot data set is presented by summary _plot matrix_ in the following `r pmatRefInfo$str`.

```{r plotmatrixDynamicChunk}
pmatChunks <- genDynChunks(pmatRefInfo, fig.height=11, fig.width=11)
```
`r knit(text = pmatChunks)`

TODO: More narrative and more visual artifacts.
