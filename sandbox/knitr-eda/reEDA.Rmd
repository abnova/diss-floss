Let's look at summary descriptive statistics for our dataset

```{r DescriptiveDataset, include=TRUE}
print(d_diamonds)
```

Now, let's examine each variable of interest individually.

Varible Price is ... Decriptive statistics for 'Price':

```{r DescriptivePrice, include=TRUE}
print(t_price)
```

Finally, let's examine price distribution across the dataset visually:

```{r VisualPrice, include=TRUE, fig.align='center'}
print(g_price)
```
