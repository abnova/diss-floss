Theoretical Formulation & Data Collection
___ Theoretical/empirical justification of models tested
___ Number and type of models tested (correlated, orthogonal, hierarchical, etc.)
___ Specification of models tested (explicit relationships between observed and latent variables)
___ Graphic representation of models tested
___ Sample characteristics (justification, sampling method, sample size)
___ Identification of equivalent and theoretically alternative models
___ Specification of model identifiably (can models be tested)?

Data Preparation
___ Screening for univariate and multivariate normality and outliers
___ Analysis of missing data and method for addressing
___ Scale of observed variables (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio; range of values)
___ Description of data transformations (include parceling)

Analysis Decisions
___ Type of matrix analyzed (covariance, correlation, etc.)
___ Matrix included or available upon request
___ Estimation procedure and justification given normality assessment (ML, S-B ML, WLS, etc.)
___ Scale of latent variables
___ Software and version

Model Evaluation
___ Inclusion of multiple fit indices (e.g., X2, df, p; RMSEA, CFI, TLI, etc.)

___ Justification and specification of cutoff values for fit indices
___ Parameter estimates (factor pattern coefficients, error variances, factor correlations, R2)
___ Specification of standardized or unstandardized parameter estimates
___ Standard errors or confidence intervals of parameter estimates
___ Examination of residual matrix
___ Description of model modification (if any)
___ Description of model cross-validation (in any)

Discussion of Model
___ Specification of final model/discussion of equivalent models
___ Study limitations and implications for theory and further research
